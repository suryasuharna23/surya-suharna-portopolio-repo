# Surya Suharna's Portopolio
1. This repository is a repository of my personal portfolio that describes my interests, experiences, and achievements so far.
2. I developed this portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
3. You can access my website by visiting https://surya-suharna-portopolio.vercel.app/ , after that you will be guided by the navigation bar at the top and can click on each section to view the content.
4. The bonus specifications that I worked on were partial bonuses in which I worked on deployment using Vercell, responsive display, and my creativity.
5. The difficulty I faced was how to make a good website blocking and look good in appearance. However, there is a drawback in this project is that it is not optimal when opened using a mobile.
6. Surya Suharna 19623125/18223075 (Information Systems and Technology, Bandung Institute of Technology) - Spartan KLAN F.
